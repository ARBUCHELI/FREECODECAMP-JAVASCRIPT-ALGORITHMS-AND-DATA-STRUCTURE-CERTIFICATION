You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

console.log("Alan Peter".length);
The value 10 would be displayed in the console.

For example, if we created a variable var firstName = "Charles", we could find out how long the string Charles is by using the firstName.length property.

Use the .length property to count the number of characters in the lastName variable and assign it to lastNameLength.

Solution:

// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line

lastNameLength = lastName.length;
