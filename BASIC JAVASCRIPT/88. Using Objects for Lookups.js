Objects can be thought of as a key/value storage, like a dictionary. If you have tabular data, you can use an object to lookup values rather than a switch statement or an
if/else chain. This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.

Here is an example of a simple reverse alphabet lookup:

var alpha = {
  1:"Z",
  2:"Y",
  3:"X",
  4:"W",
  ...
  24:"C",
  25:"B",
  26:"A"
};
alpha[2];
alpha[24];

var value = 2;
alpha[value];
alpha[2] is the string Y, alpha[24] is the string C, and alpha[value] is the string Y.

Convert the switch statement into an object called lookup. Use it to look up val and assign the associated string to the result variable.
