## ES6: Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays

ES6 makes destructuring arrays as easy as destructuring objects.

One key difference between the spread operator and array destructuring is that the spread operator unpacks all contents of an array into a comma-separated list. Consequently, you cannot pick or choose which elements you want to assign to variables.

Destructuring an array lets us do exactly that:

```html
const [a, b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b); // 1, 2
```

The variable <code>a</code> is assigned the first value of the array, and <code>b</code> is assigned the second value of the array. We can also access the value at any index in an array with destructuring by using commas to reach the desired index:

```html
const [a, b,,, c] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b, c); // 1, 2, 5
```

Use destructuring assignment to swap the values of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> so that <code>a</code> receives the value stored in <code>b</code>, and <code>b</code> receives the value stored in <code>a</code>.

```html
let a = 8, b = 6;
// Only change code below this line
[a,b] = [b,a];
console.log(a,b);
```

## ES6: Use Destructuring Assignment with the Rest Parameter to Reassign Array Elements

In some situations involving array destructuring, we might want to collect the rest of the elements into a separate array.

The result is similar to ```html Array.prototype.slice()```, as shown below:

```html
const [a, b, ...arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7];
console.log(a, b); // 1, 2
console.log(arr); // [3, 4, 5, 7]
```

Variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> take the first and second values from the array. After that, because of the rest parameter's presence, <code>arr</code> gets the rest of the values in the form of an array. The rest element only works correctly as the last variable in the list. As in, you cannot use the rest parameter to catch a subarray that leaves out the last element of the original array.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Use destructuring assignment with the rest parameter to perform an effective ```html Array.prototype.slice()``` so that <code>arr</code> is a sub-array of the original array source with the first two elements omitted.

```html
const source = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
function removeFirstTwo(list) {
  "use strict";
  // Only change code below this line
  const [a,b, ...arr] = list; // Change this line
  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}
const arr = removeFirstTwo(source);
```

## ES6: Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters

In some cases, you can destructure the object in a function argument itself.

Consider the code below:

```html
const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
  const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;
  // do something with these variables
}
```

This effectively destructures the object sent into the function. This can also be done in-place:

```html
const profileUpdate = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {
  /* do something with these fields */
}
```
When <code>profileData</code> is passed to the above function, the values are destructured from the function parameter for use within the function.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Use destructuring assignment within the argument to the function <code>half</code> to send only <code>max</code> and <code>min</code> inside the function.

```html
const stats = {
  max: 56.78,
  standard_deviation: 4.34,
  median: 34.54,
  mode: 23.87,
  min: -0.75,
  average: 35.85
};

// Only change code below this line
const half = ({max,min}) => (max + min) / 2.0; 
// Only change code above this line
```

# INTERMEDIATE ALGORITHM SCRIPTING

## Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Sum All Numbers in a RangePassed

We'll pass you an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers plus the sum of all the numbers between them. The lowest number will not always come first.

For example, <code>sumAll([4,1])</code> should return <code>10</code> because sum of all the numbers between 1 and 4 (both inclusive) is <code>10</code>.

```html
function sumAll(arr) {
  let max = Math.max(arr[0], arr[1]);
  let min = Math.min(arr[0], arr[1]);
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = min; i <= max; i++){
    sum = sum + i;
  }
  return sum;
}

sumAll([1, 4]);
```

## Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Diff Two Arrays

Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, but not both. In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.

## Note
You can return the array with its elements in any order.

```html
function diffArray(arr1, arr2) {
  var newArr = [];

  function onlyInone(firstarr, secondarr) {
    // Looping through an array to find elements that don't exist in another array
    for (var i = 0; i < firstarr.length; i++) {
      if (secondarr.indexOf(firstarr[i]) === -1) {
        // Pushing the elements unique to first to newArr
        newArr.push(firstarr[i]);
      }
    }
  }

  onlyInone(arr1, arr2);
  onlyInone(arr2, arr1);

  return newArr;
}

diffArray([1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```
                            
## Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Seek and Destroy

You will be provided with an initial array (the first argument in the destroyer function), followed by one or more arguments. Remove all elements from the initial array that
are of the same value as these arguments.

## Note
You have to use the <code>arguments</code> object.

```html
function destroyer(arr) {
  var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);

  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < args.length; j++) {
      if (arr[i] === args[j]) {
        delete arr[i];
      }
    }
  }
  return arr.filter(Boolean);
}
```

## Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Wherefore art thou

Make a function that looks through an array of objects (first argument) and returns an array of all objects that have matching name and value pairs (second argument). Each name and value pair of the source object has to be present in the object from the collection if it is to be included in the returned array.

For example, if the first argument is ```htmls[{ first: "Romeo", last: "Montague" }, { first: "Mercutio", last: null }, { first: "Tybalt", last: "Capulet" }]```, and the second argument is ```html{ last: "Capulet" }```, then you must return the third object from the array (the first argument), because it contains the name and its value, that was passed on as the second argument.

```html
function whatIsInAName(collection, source) {
  var arr = Object.keys(source);
  // Only change code below this line
  return collection.filter(function(obj) {
    return arr.map(function(key){
      return obj.hasOwnProperty(key) && obj[key] === source[key];
    })
    .reduce(function(a, b){
      return a && b;
    });
  });
}

  // Only change code above this line

  // filter the collection

whatIsInAName([{ first: "Romeo", last: "Montague" }, { first: "Mercutio", last: null }, { first: "Tybalt", last: "Capulet" }], { last: "Capulet" });
```
